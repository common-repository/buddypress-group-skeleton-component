== Description ==

This is a bare-bones component that should provide a good starting block to building your own custom BuddyPress Group component.

The plugin was developed to help Buddypress lovers get started with and, explore the endless possibilities of Buddypress groups. With some simple extra functionality, you can transform the function of your groups and even your site. 

The plugin preforms a basic function - save group meta ( data ) via thr group creating process and/or via 'edit group details' and returns the data on the group's home page.

This is the basis for the existing Buddypress Twitter, Buddypress Google Plus and Buddypress Klout plugins - They all preform the same basic function, though as you can see, can be used in a variety of ways.
